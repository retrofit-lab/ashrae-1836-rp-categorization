The fume generation rate can be cut almost in half by changing from 100% CO2 shielding gas to a mixture of Argon with 25% CO2 shielding gas. A further reduction in fume generation rate can be achieved by use of a shielding gas containing Argon with only 5% CO2 along with the appropriate electrode,X0000
